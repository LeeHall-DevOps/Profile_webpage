<p>Hello, My name is Lee Hall. I am a Junior DevOps Consultant with Sparta.<br><br>

I have been passionate about learning different technologies since my early teens, I started my successful and exciting tech career as a freelance contractor, achieving mostly front-end developments to the clientâ€™s satisfaction. 
I have always been passionate about learning new and powerful software, and that passion motivated me to join Codecademy courses where I achieved completion of Full stack development and acquired knowledge of JavaScript, TDD, Agile SDLC, and many more.
In my current role in DevOps, I have been learning powerful technologies such as Aws cloud computing, and ansible.<br><br>



In my spare time, I enjoy swimming, I am a passionate reader, and enjoy building and upgrading my PC. My greatest achievement is raising my daughter who has autist challenges, I encourage her with Maths homework, reassuring and encouraging her to be confident. 
I have assisted her to achieve a better standard of living, I encourage her to be Passionate about what excites her learning.
I am excited that I will be learning terraform, docker and Kubernetes
